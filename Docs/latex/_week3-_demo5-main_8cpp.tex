Getting the input state in real time Now, we have gone through many varieties of events.\+A problem with events is that they report once when the state changes, but you cannot continuously ask them how the state of the input devices look right now.

\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Getting the input state in real time Now, we have gone through many varieties of events.\+A problem with events is that they report once when the state changes, but you cannot continuously ask them how the state of the input devices look right now. 

But SFML, in an effort to make input management easier, has implemented classes that let you access these states in real time whenever you want from wherever you want. We will use the notion of real-\/time input to denote this alternative method of handling user input.
