\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Fixed Time Steps Consider that a frame may sometimes take three times the average delta time. 

This can lead to severe mistakes in the game logic, for example, when a player moves three times the distance and passes through a wall he would normally collide with. This is why physics engines expect the delta time to be fixed.
