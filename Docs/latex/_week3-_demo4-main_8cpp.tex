\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Entities We have a base class called \mbox{\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity}}, which contains the data and functionality that all different kinds of entities have in common. 

We have multiple classes that derive from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity}}, and that implement specific functionality. These derived classes could represent airplanes, projectiles (such as missiles), or pickups. We implement the velocity attribute in the base class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_entity}{Entity}}, so each concrete entity has it.
