\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
\mbox{\hyperlink{class_texture_holder}{Texture\+Holder}} We must find the right data structure to store the textures. 

We need to choose an STL container that does not perform unnecessary copies. std\+::vector is the wrong choice, since inserting new textures can trigger a reallocation of the dynamic array and the copying of all textures. Not only is this slow, but also all references and pointers to the textures are invalidated. We can access the textures by an enum, so the associative container std\+::map looks like the perfect choice.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
\+: m\+Background\+Texture.\+set\+Repeated(true); Repeating is involved when using texture coordinates outside the texture rectangle \mbox{[}0, 0, width, height\mbox{]}. In this case, if repeat mode is enabled, the whole texture will be repeated as many times as needed to reach the coordinate (for example, if the X texture coordinate is 3 $\ast$ width, the texture will be repeated 3 times). If repeat mode is disabled, the \char`\"{}extra space\char`\"{} will instead be filled with border pixels.

\+: landscape.\+set\+Texture\+Rect(sf\+::\+Int\+Rect(0, 0, 1200, 800)); Set the sub-\/rectangle of the texture that the sprite will display.
\end{DoxyNote}
The texture rect is useful when you don\textquotesingle{}t want to display the whole texture, but rather a part of it. By default, the texture rect covers the entire texture.
